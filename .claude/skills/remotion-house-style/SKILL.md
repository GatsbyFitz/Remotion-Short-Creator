## When to use

Whenever asked to build a new Remotion composition/graphic for this project (list reveals, gauges, timelines, counters, block builds, etc.) that should look and animate consistently with the existing ones. Pair with the `remotion-best-practices` skill for general Remotion API knowledge (fonts, captions, ffmpeg, sequencing) — this skill covers this project's specific design system and conventions, not generic Remotion usage.

## Brand system

**Fonts are loaded from vendored files, not Typekit.** The Typekit stylesheet in
`src/app/layout.tsx` belongs to the Next app and is never pulled into the Remotion
bundle, so a family that isn't loaded explicitly silently falls back to
`sans-serif` — and a family that *appears* to work may only be resolving because
it happens to be installed on that machine, which breaks on CI or any other
computer. Brand fonts are therefore loaded in `src/remotion/fonts.ts` (imported by
`src/remotion/index.ts`) via `@remotion/fonts` `loadFont()` from files in
`public/fonts/`. `.otf`, `.ttf`, `.woff` and `.woff2` all work.

To add a font: drop the file in `public/fonts/`, add a `loadFont()` entry to the
`Promise.all` in `src/remotion/fonts.ts` with the family name used in
`BRAND_FONTS`, and verify by rendering it under a deliberately fake alias — if the
alias renders correctly, the file is genuinely being used rather than a system
install. Currently only `baga` is vendored; `le-havre-rounded` (`BRAND_FONTS.secondary`)
and `Pollen` (`BRAND_FONTS.tertiary`) have no file yet and will render as
`sans-serif` until one is added.

Always import from `src/remotion/theme.ts` rather than hardcoding hex values or font names:

- `BRAND_COLORS`: black `#000000`, pink `#FF37A1`, yellow `#E1FF62`, textPrimary black, textSecondary `rgba(0,0,0,0.7)`, textLight white, trackLine `rgba(255,55,161,0.15)`
- `BRAND_FONTS`: `primary` = "baga" (titles/headlines, semibold weight), `secondary` = "le-havre-rounded" (body/labels, lighter weight), `tertiary` = "Pollen" (accents/special emphasis)

Pink-to-yellow gradients (`linear-gradient(90deg, ${BRAND_COLORS.pink}, ${BRAND_COLORS.yellow})`) are a recurring accent for underlines, progress fills, and gauge arcs.

## File & folder conventions

- One composition per folder: `src/remotion/<ComponentName>/Main.tsx`
- Export the component **and** an async `calculateMetadata` function from the same file
- Component names are plain nouns describing the visual — PascalCase, no "Composition" suffix (`PushUpTypes`, `MaxThreshold80`, `TwoYearTimeline`, `PriorityList`)

## Export / canvas conventions

Existing compositions render as **transparent overlays** meant to sit on top of real footage, not standalone videos. Transparency is the default preference for every new composition unless told otherwise:

- No solid `backgroundColor` on the outer `AbsoluteFill` — either omit `backgroundColor` entirely or set it explicitly to `"transparent"` for self-documentation
- `calculateMetadata` should return `fps: 30`, `width: 1920`, `height: 1080` (unless told otherwise), plus:
  ```ts
  defaultCodec: "prores" as const,
  defaultVideoImageFormat: "png" as const,
  defaultPixelFormat: "yuva444p10le" as const,
  defaultProResProfile: "4444" as const,
  ```
  This is what preserves the alpha channel for overlay use — don't drop it. Both
  halves are load-bearing: `png` because JPEG has no alpha channel and would
  flatten transparency before encoding, and the `yuva…`/ProRes `4444` pair
  because that's what carries alpha through the video codec. Drop either and you
  get an opaque render regardless of the other.
- **Render scale is 2x, and it is NOT a `calculateMetadata` field.** `CalcMetadataReturnType`
  has no `scale` property — scale only exists as a render-level setting. It is set
  once, project-wide, in `remotion.config.ts` via `Config.setScale(2)`, so a
  1920x1080 composition renders at 3840x2160. Don't try to add `scale` to a
  composition's metadata (it won't type-check and wouldn't do anything); to
  override it for a one-off render, pass `--scale=<n>` on the CLI. `remotion.config.ts`
  also pins `Config.setVideoImageFormat("png")` and `Config.setStillImageFormat("png")`
  for the alpha reason above — do not set either back to `jpeg`.
- Choose text/shape colors assuming they'll sit over arbitrary video, not a fixed background: black (as in `PushUpTypes`, `MaxThreshold80`) reads on light footage, light/yellow (as in `TwoYearTimeline`) reads on dark footage. Ask which is likely if it's not obvious from the brief.
- **Known gotcha:** `styles/global.css` (shared with the Next.js app via `src/app/layout.tsx`) applies a solid `body { @apply bg-background }` with `--background: #000000`, and it is imported by `src/remotion/index.ts` — so the Remotion bundle does pull in an opaque body background. In practice rendered frames still come out with real alpha (verified by rendering overlay stills and inspecting them), because the composition's own `AbsoluteFill` is what gets captured, not the page body. If you ever *do* see an opaque background bleed through, fix it in a Remotion-scoped stylesheet imported after `global.css` in `src/remotion/index.ts` (forcing `html, body { background: transparent !important; }`) — don't edit `global.css` itself, since it's shared and its body background is intentional for the Next app.

## Animation conventions

- CSS transitions/animations and Tailwind animation classes are forbidden — everything is driven by `useCurrentFrame()` with `interpolate()` / `spring()`
- Typical easing: `Easing.bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` for a snappy-decelerate entrance; `Easing.inOut(Easing.cubic)` for continuous scroll/roll motion
- Typical spring config for staggered card/row entrances: `{ damping: 200, stiffness: 120, mass: 0.8 }`, staggered by offsetting `frame - baseDelay - index * stepDelay`
- Common opener: a title/intro fade + rise (opacity 0→1, `translateY` ~18-20px→0) over the first ~15-28 frames before the main animation begins

## Reusable motifs — pick based on the ask

1. **Staggered card/list reveal** — items spring in one after another, side by side or stacked. See `src/remotion/PushUpTypes/Main.tsx`.
2. **Progress bar / timeline** — SVG line with a moving marker and tick labels. See `src/remotion/TwoYearTimeline/Main.tsx`.
3. **Radial gauge / threshold ring** — SVG arc with gradient stroke filling toward a value. See `src/remotion/MaxThreshold80/Main.tsx`, `src/remotion/Gauge/Main.tsx`.
4. **Block build-up** — counting/building blocks. See `src/remotion/PushUp100BlocksBuild`, `src/remotion/BlocksTimesThree`, `src/remotion/ThreeBlocksReveal`.
5. **Rolling/rolodex list scan** — a long list scrolls through a masked viewport, the centered item is highlighted (e.g. color shift + scale), and it lands on a final item. Good for "sequence through N items until you reach X" briefs, works well for lists too long to reveal all at once (10-100+ items). See `src/remotion/PriorityList/Main.tsx` for a full worked example (100-item scroll with a `mask-image` fade at the viewport edges, `Easing.inOut(Easing.cubic)` for the roll, and a settle-pulse on the final item).
6. **Traveling highlight bar** — a static stacked list where a highlight pill/bar moves down to the active row instead of the whole list scrolling. Better fit than the rolodex for short lists (roughly ≤8 items) where every item should stay visible on screen at once.

When the brief is a list that sequences to a final/bottom item, ask (or infer from list length) whether a traveling highlight bar (short list, everything visible) or a rolodex scroll (long list, masked viewport) fits better.

## Registering a new composition

In `src/remotion/Root.tsx`:

1. Import the component and its `calculateMetadata`, aliasing the latter (e.g. `calculateMetadata as calculate<Name>Metadata`) since every composition file exports a function with that same name
2. Add a `<Composition>` inside the `<Folder name="Visuals">` block with `id`, `component`, `width`, `height`, `fps`, a `durationInFrames` that matches what `calculateMetadata` will compute (this is only the Studio's initial guess before `calculateMetadata` resolves — keep it in sync so the two don't disagree), and `calculateMetadata`

## Sanity check

Render one or two still frames to confirm layout and timing before calling it done:

```bash
npx remotion still <composition-id> --scale=0.5 --frame=<n> out.png
```

(The project default is `scale: 2`, so pass an explicit small `--scale` like this
for quick checks — otherwise every sanity-check still renders at 3840x2160.)

Check a frame partway through the animation and a frame at the final held state (e.g. the last item, the completed gauge).
